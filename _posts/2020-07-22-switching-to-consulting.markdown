After several years as a DevOps Engineer in an enterprise environment, I've decided to switch over to consulting. I've landed a job offer with a US based consultancy and because of my Canadian citizenship/residence I have to set myself up as an independent contractor with this change. Below are my thoughts:

#### No Benefits
In Ontario, we have OHIP that covers hospital and family doctor visits, but I'll be missing out on:
* Vision benefits
* Dental benefits
* Life insurance
* Travel insurance
* Retirement Contributions
* Unemployment insurance
Fortunately, the increase in raw compensation helps offset some of these costs and I can get creative with some others. (I'm looking at you [TD First Class Travel Visa Infinite](https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/credit-cards/travel-rewards/first-class-travel-visa-infinite-card/))

#### Expensing Purchases
With this foray into consulting, I am now techincally self-employed. This means I can expense anything that qualifies as a business expense. The list is long and I'm frequently getting lost in the CRA's website, but this could easily equate to thousands of dollars in savings every year.

#### Profit Center
When working as a DevOps Engineer (or any IT role really) in an enterprise setting, you do not make your company money. You could argue that DevOps allows teams to ship reliable software and respond to customer demand faster than before, but there's too many steps between the work of a DevOps Engineer does and where revenue enters the business. That's what sales teams are for.

Consulting changes this relationship. As a consultant, I now directly make my company money by billing clients for my work. This fosters a more competitive and inherently riskier working environment, but I'm hoping it comes with its own set of rewards as well.

#### Two bosses
Another interesting change with consulting is the fact that I have 2 bosses: often with competing priorities.

Within the consultancy, I have my manager. His priority will be for me to make the consultancy money. My second boss is the client whose priority is to get as much quality work out of me as possible while paying as little as possible. 

This creates an interesting dynamic where my job is to please both, but it creates a balancing act between profit and client satisfaction.
